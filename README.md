# SportCompetition
OOP homework in which I had to use Design Patterns to simulate a sports competition. I firstly had to register the teams, using Factory and Singleton. Afterwards, I set up matches of each team versus every other one, using Visitor and Strategy. After the matches ended, I updated the final score and place in leader board using Observer.
